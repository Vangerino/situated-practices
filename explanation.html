    <p>‘ASCII Eyes’ is a photographic project comprising of environmental photographs converted to ASCII art, which uses unicode symbols in the place of pixels. This conversion of the image completely strips it of any colour and detail, leaving vague outlines and reducing the original photograph to its most basic form, which is a stark contrast to the ultra high resolution digital images we are used to today.</p>

    <p>The project is in the context of the digital space, and aims to delve into the relationship between the digital space/internet and the real world. In the modern day, much of life is mediated by technology and by presenting my photographs in the format of ASCII art (a relic of 1990s computing rarely used today) I wanted to draw attention to the way that technology has changed our perception of reality. The visual presentation was inspired by the work of Waldemar Cordeiro, who used similar techniques in his work, using a computer and typewriter to ascribe different characters to sections of the image. The project also references art styles from the early internet, glitch aesthetics and abstraction.</p>

    <p>I would consider the work to be almost ‘post-photography’ in the sense that the image is less about the visual content of the image and more about the technique and effects. My process for this project began with the idea to distort images and build on a past project which used symbols in the context of photography (albeit in a far more abstract sense). In order to get the effect I used conversion tools which turn my original images into ASCII text. The website for the project was intended to be equally as abstract, and I wanted the user experience to center around the distortion and reassembly of the images with the use of zoom sliders which start at a high zoom level and can be adjusted to reveal the whole image, highlighting the effect of the ASCII art.</p>
