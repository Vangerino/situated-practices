  <h1>ASCII Eyes – Written Statement</h1>

  <p>My project ‘ASCII Eyes’ is a visual exploration of the digital world, comprising environmental photographs converted into ASCII art, which uses unicode symbols in place of pixels. This transformation completely strips the image of colour and detail, leaving only vague outlines and reducing it to its most basic form—a stark contrast to the ultra-high-resolution digital photography that dominates contemporary visual culture.</p>

  <p>The project is situated within the context of the digital space and aims to examine the relationship between the digital world and the real world. In modern life, experience is increasingly mediated through technology, and by presenting my photographs as ASCII art—a relic of 1990s computing rarely used today—I wanted to draw attention to the ways in which technology alters our perception of reality.</p>

  <p>The presentation was inspired by the work of Waldemar Cordeiro, who used similar methods, employing computers and typewriters to assign characters to different parts of an image. The work also draws from early internet aesthetics, glitch art, and abstraction. I see this project as a form of post-photography, where the image becomes less about visual content and more about the technique and the digital processes behind it.</p>

  <p>The idea originated from a desire to distort and abstract imagery, building on a previous project where I used symbols in a photographic context (though in a more conceptual way). To produce these pieces, I used conversion tools to turn original photographs into ASCII text. The website presentation was designed to be equally abstract, with the user experience focused on distortion, deconstruction, and reassembly, aided by interactive zoom sliders.</p>
